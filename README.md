# dead-battery-ws
A software program that alerts the UT Robotics researchers that the BWI bot has a low battery and is headed back to the charging port. At the moment the BWI robot in the UT Robotics Lab dies in place and the team has to roam the whole building looking for it. Our solution to this problem was to notify the researchers when the robot's battery is about to die.
